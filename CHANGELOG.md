## 2026-06-28 — Zigbee Network Live & *Arr Pipeline Fix

### 🏠 Smart Home
- **MQTT connected** to HA via UI (10.0.1.100:1883, no auth) — wired up successfully
- **4 Zigbee devices paired:**
  - Aqara temp/humidity sensor
  - Third Reality motion sensor
  - 2× TRÅDFRI color bulbs (hue/sat/brightness)
- **Permit join** enabled/disabled to add bulbs
- **Tuya/Kasa integrations** lost in HA snapshot rollback (need re-add)
- **Snapshot incident:** HA VM rolled back to `pre-ha-setup` after config.yaml MQTT modification caused boot loop. Lesson: always configure MQTT via HA UI in 2026.x.

### 🎬 Media Stack
- **RDTClient pipeline fixed:**
  - Root cause: `AutoImport=False` — RDTClient never pulled files from Real-Debrid
  - Switched to **Torrent Blackhole** watch folder approach (more reliable than qBittorrent API)
  - Categories mapped: `tv-sonarr` → `/downloads/tv-sonarr/`, `radarr` → `/downloads/radarr/`
  - Download limit bumped to 8
- **Godzilla Minus One** added to Radarr (HD-1080p, searching)
- **Bleach TYBW S17** added to Sonarr (monitoring, old seasons unmonitored)
- **8 indexers** synced via Prowlarr to both Sonarr and Radarr

### 🔧 Infrastructure
- **GitHub SSH key** added for agent push access
- **Weekly documentation cron** configured (Sundays)
